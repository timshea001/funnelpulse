## Architecture Decisions

### Database
- **PostgreSQL** via Prisma ORM
- Schema includes all tables from spec:
  - Users (with onboarding data and subscription info)
  - Ad Accounts (with encrypted tokens)
  - Reports (with JSONB for flexibility)
  - Scheduled Reports
  - Report Deliveries
  - Benchmarks (pre-seeded)
  - Team Members

### Authentication
- **Clerk** for user authentication
- Middleware protects all routes except public pages
- User data synced between Clerk and database

### AI Insights
- **Hybrid approach**: Rule-based + OpenAI
- Rule-based fallback ensures functionality without API key
- GPT-4o-mini for cost efficiency
- JSON response format for structured parsing
- Caching to avoid duplicate API calls

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS 4** with custom configuration
- Design system based on Atria reference screenshot
- Orange brand color (#FF6B35)
- Status colors: Green (good), Amber (warning), Red (bad)
- Responsive design: Desktop-first, mobile-friendly

### API Integration
- Meta Ads Marketing API (OAuth ready)
- Stripe for payments
- Resend for emails
- OpenAI for insights

## Placeholders & External Dependencies

### Required External Services

1. **Meta Developer App**
   - Status: Placeholder implemented
   - Needed: Create app, get credentials, request permissions
   - Impact: Cannot fetch real Meta Ads data without this

2. **Stripe Account**
   - Status: SDK installed, endpoints planned
   - Needed: Create products, configure webhooks
   - Impact: Cannot process payments without this

3. **Resend Account**
   - Status: SDK installed
   - Needed: API key, domain verification
   - Impact: Cannot send emails without this

4. **OpenAI API**
   - Status: Fully implemented with fallback
   - Needed: API key for AI insights
   - Impact: Falls back to rule-based insights (still functional)

5. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Status: Schema created, needs instance
   - Needed: Database connection string
   - Impact: App won't run without database
   - Quick setup: Docker PostgreSQL or Supabase free tier

## Quick Start for Development

To get this running locally:

1. **Set up PostgreSQL**:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Docker
   docker run --name funneliq-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

   # Option 2: Use Supabase free tier
   ```

2. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your credentials
   ```

3. **Initialize database**:
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Run development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Next Steps Priority

To make this MVP functional, prioritize in this order:

1. **Database Setup** (Required)
   - Set up PostgreSQL instance
   - Run migrations
   - Seed benchmarks

2. **Basic Auth Flow** (Required)
   - Clerk sign-in/sign-up pages
   - User creation in database

3. **Onboarding Flow** (High Priority)
   - Business context form
   - Product economics calculator
   - Save to database

4. **Dashboard with Mock Data** (High Priority)
   - Create layout
   - Build components
   - Use mock/sample data initially

5. **Meta Ads Integration** (Medium Priority)
   - Can be developed with mock data
   - Real integration needs Meta app approval

6. **Report Generation** (High Priority)
   - Build with mock data first
   - Integrate real data once Meta API connected

7. **Scheduled Reports & Email** (Medium Priority)
   - Can wait until core reporting works

8. **Billing** (Medium Priority)
   - Can use manual tier assignment initially
   - Full Stripe integration for production

## Testing Strategy

Without external services, you can still test:

1. **UI/UX**: All components and pages
2. **Calculations**: Profitability metrics, conversion rates
3. **Rule-based logic**: Benchmark comparisons, funnel analysis
4. **Database operations**: CRUD operations on all models
5. **Mock data flows**: Simulate full user journey with sample data
